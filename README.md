This is a Counter App that uses React.

It's a Counter which adds 1 or subtracts 1 from the Total. The Total can also be reset.

It also tells you if the current number is divisible by numbers between 0 to 8. Each divisibilty method is in its own component file for now, which is clearly a terrible way of doing it, but for the moment, it's working.

The drawing of The Count was traced over an image using vectr.com then exported as an SVG.
